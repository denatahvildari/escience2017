\f0\fs22\fsmilli11040 \cf0 Phytic acid and lower inositol phosphates were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a Dionex (Sunnyvale, CA, USA) DX300, ICS2500 system with a suppressed conductivity detector range of 10 \'b5S.15 An AS11 chromatographic column (Dionex) with a guard column was used. All analyses (20-\'b5L injection volume) were carried out at room temperature. The eluents (flow-rate 1 mL min\uc0\u8722 1) used were as follows: 0\'965 min, 0.2 g dm\u8722 3 NaOH; 5\'9615 min, linear gradient of 0.2\'964 g dm\u8722 3 NaOH; 15\'9620 min, 20 g dm\u8722 3 NaOH; and finally 20\'9635 min, 0.2 g dm\u8722 3 NaOH. A 100-mg amount of sample (previously dried and ground) was placed in a glass tube and mixed with 10 mL of 18.25 g dm\u8722 3 HCl containing 50 mg dm\u8722 3cis-aconitate (internal standard). }
