\f0\fs22\fsmilli11040 \cf0 Liquid chromatography was performed on a Thermo Accela UHPLC system (Waltham, MA, USA) equipped with a Hypercarb column (PGC, 100 mm \'d7 2.1 mm; 3 \uc0\u956 m, Thermo Electron Corporation, San Jos\'e9, USA) in combination with a Hypercarb guard column (10 mm \'d7 2.1 mm; 3 \u956 m, Thermo Electron Corporation). Elution was performed with a flow of 0.4 mL/min and a column oven temperature of 70 \'b0C. The injection volume was set to 10 \u956 L. The following eluents were used: Millipore water (A), acetonitrile (B) and 0.2% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in water (TFA, C), to all eluents 25 \u956 M sodium acetate was added to ensure sodium adducts of all components. The following gradient was used: 0\'961 min, isocratic 100% A, 1\'9615 min, linear from 0 to 27.5% (v/v) B, 15\'9628 min linear from 27.5 to 60% B and concomitant linear from 0 to 10% (v/v) C, 28\'9631 min linear from 60 to 80% B and from 10 to 20% C, 31\'9635 min isocratic 80% B and 20% C, 35\'9636 min from 80% B and 20% C to 100% A, 36\'9641 min equilibration with 100% A.\

The PGC-column was coupled to a 1:1-splitter (Accurate, Dionex, Sunnivale, USA) directing the eluent both to the evaporative light scattering detector (ELSD 85, Sedere, Alfortville Cedex, France) and to the ESI-MSn-detector (LTQ XL MS, ion trap, Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA, USA).}
