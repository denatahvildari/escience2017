\f0\fs22\fsmilli11040 \cf0 Diluted protein samples (20 \uc0\u956 l, 5 mg/ml) in 0.1 M ammonium acetate were applied to a Superdex 75 10/300 GL column (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) with a \'c4kta Purifier system at room temperature. The column was equilibrated and eluted with 0.1 M ammonium acetate solution at a flow rate of 0.9 ml/min. The eluate was monitored at 280 nm. Calibration of the column was performed with a low molecular weight gel filtration calibration kit (Amersham Biosciences). The kit contained blue dextran (2000k), albumin (67k), ovalbumin (43k), chymotrypsinogen A (25k) and ribonuclease A (13.7k). The areas (at 280 nm) of the peaks were calculated with Unicorn software (GE-Healthcare, Chalfont St. Giles, UK) divided over four sections.}
