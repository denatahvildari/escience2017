\f0\fs22\fsmilli11040 \cf0 The chromatographic analysis was carried out on a Thermo Accela UHPLC system (San Jose, CA, USA) equipped with a pump, autosampler and photodiode array (PDA) detector. The solubilised samples (5\uc0\u8201 \u956 L) were injected on a RP Hypersil Gold C18-column (150 \'d7 2.1\u8201 mm, 1.9\u8201 \'b5m particle size, from Thermo Scientific). The eluents used were acidified water with 0.1% (v/v) acetic acid and 1% (v/v) acetonitrile (eluent A), and acetonitrile acidified with 0.1% (v/v) acetic acid (eluent B). The flow rate was 400 \u956 L/ min, and data acquisition was performed in the range of 200\'96600\u8201 nm.}
