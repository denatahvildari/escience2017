\f0\fs22\fsmilli11040 \cf0 HPAEC was performed to quantify GOS degradation during the experiments. The samples collected were 10x diluted with Millipore water (0.42 mg mL\uc0\u8722 1) and analysed using an ICS 3000 HPLC system (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA), equipped with a CarboPac PA-1 column (2 mm ID \'d7 250 mm; Dionex) in combination with a CarboPac PA guard column (2 mm ID \'d7 25 mm) and an ISC 3000 ED detector (Dionex) in the PAD mode. A flow rate of 0.3 mL min\u8722 1 was used with the following elution profile of 0.1 M sodium hydroxide (solution A) and 1 M sodium acetate in 0.1 M sodium hydroxide (solution B): 0\'9620 min, 0\'9620% B; 20\'9626 min washing step with 100% B; 26\'9641 min, equilibration with 100% A. Twenty microlitres of sample was injected each time.}
