\f0\fs22\fsmilli11040 \cf0 Samples were analyzed using an Accela UHPLC system (Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA, USA) equipped with pump, autosampler, and PDA detector. Samples (1 \uc0\u956 L) were injected onto an Acquity UPLC BEH C18 column (2.1\u8201 \'d7\u8201 150 mm, 1.7 \u956 m particle size) with an Acquity UPLC BEH C18 Vanguard pre-column (2.1\u8201 \'d7\u8201 5 mm, 1.7 \u956 m particle size; Waters, Milford, MA, USA). Eluents were water-acidified with 0.1% (v/v) acetic acid (eluent A) and acetonitrile-acidified with 0.1% (v/v) acetic acid (eluent B). The flow rate was 300 \u956 L/min, and the PDA detector was set to measure at a range of 205\'96400 nm. The following elution profile was used at 0\'9618 min, linear gradient from 10\'96100% (v/v) B; 18\'9622 min, isocratic on 100% B; 22\'9623 min, linear gradient from 100\'9610% B; and 23\'9625 min, isocratic on 10% B.}
