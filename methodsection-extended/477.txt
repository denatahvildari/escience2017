\f0\fs22\fsmilli11040 \cf0 HPSEC was performed, using a Dionex UltiMate 3000 system (Sunnyvale, CA, USA) equipped with three TSK gel columns (TSK gel Super AW4000, 3000, 2500; 150 \'d7 6 mm ID; Tosoh Bioscience, Tokyo, Japan) and a guard column (Super AW-L, Tosoh Bioscience). For each hydrolysate sample, 20 \uc0\u956 l of solution were injected and the system was operated at 40 \'b0C using 0.2 M NaNO3 (0.6 ml/min). Eluting compounds were monitored using a Shodex RI-101 Refractive Index detector (Showa Denko, Kawasaki, Japan). Chromeleon software (Dionex) was used to control the HPLC system and to process the data. The HPSEC system was calibrated with pullulan standards (Polymer Laboratories, Shropshire, UK) of various molecular weights.}
