\f0\fs22\fsmilli11040 \cf0 the molecular weight (MW) distribution of \uc0\u946 -glucan samples and \u946 -glucanase treated \u946 -glucan samples were accessed using high-pressure size-exclusion chromatography (HP-SEC) coupled with multi-angle laser light scattering (MALLS) and refractive index (RI) detectors. The Viscotek GPC system was used in the HP-SEC measurement. The measurement was performed using two ViscoGEL columns (300 \'d7 7.8 mm), type GMHHR-M + Guard column running at 70\'b0C. The mobile phase was N,N-dimethylacetamide with 0.5% LiCl at a rate of 0.5 mL/min. Samples were prepared at 3 mg \u946 -glucan powder in 1 mL DMAc+0.5% LiCl and passed through 0.45 \u956 m filter before injection (100 \u956 L). The OmniSECTM version 4 (MD Scientific, Denmark) was used to calculate MW distribution. Shodex Pullulan standard from 0.59 \'d7 104 to 160 \'d7 104 Da was used to prepare a calibration curve.}
