\f0\fs22\fsmilli11040 \cf0 HPLC analysis was performed with a Spectra Physics P1000 solvent\
delivery system equipped with an AS3000 autosampler and UV3000\
absorbance detector (Thermo Separations Products, Fremont CA).\
Portions of 20 \'b5L of sample were injected on a Spherisorb 5 ODS-2\
column (4.6 i.d. \'d7 250 mm) (Chrompack, Middelburg, The Netherlands)\
equilibrated with a mixture of 40% (v/v) acetone, 40% (v/v)\
acetonitrile, 20% (v/v) water, and 0.1% (v/v) formic acid at a flow\
rate of 1.0 mL/min. Separation was achieved by eluting isocratically\
for 4 min with the starting eluent, followed by a linear gradient to a\
mixture of 60% (v/v) acetone and 40% acetonitrile, containing 0.1%\
(v/v) formic acid. Next, the column was eluted isocratically for 3 min\
using this mixture. Eluting compounds were detected using a Sedex\
55 evaporative light scattering detector (SEDERE, Alfortville, France)\
set to a temperature of 25 \'b0C and using an air pressure of 2.5 bar.}
