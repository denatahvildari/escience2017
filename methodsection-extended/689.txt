\f0\fs22\fsmilli11040 \cf0 All purification steps were performed at 4\'b0C. The crude enzyme was precipitated at 30\'9665% saturation of (NH4)2SO4, and the protein was collected by centrifugation (10,000 g, 15 min) and dissolved in 20 mM Tris\'96HCl buffer (pH 7.8, Buffer A) with 1 M (NH4)2SO4. The crude enzyme solution was applied to a Phenyl Sepharose 6 FF column (1.5\'d720 cm2). Elution was carried out with a linear gradient of 0.5\'960.0 M (NH4)2SO4 in the buffer A. Next, this diluted enzyme solution was loaded on a DEAE-Sepharose FF column (1.5\'d720 cm2). The column was washed with Buffer B (20 mM Tris\'96HCl buffer pH 9.4). Active fractions were passed through a Sephadex G-50 column (2.5\'d7100 cm2) using buffer A. Finally, active fractions were pooled and concentrated by lyophilization or PEG 20000.}
