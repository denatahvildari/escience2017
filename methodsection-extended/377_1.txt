\f0\fs22\fsmilli11040 \cf0 High-performance size-exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) was carried out using an HPLC (ThermoFinnigan, United States), with three TSK-gel columns in series (7.5 \'d7 300 mm per column, G4000PWXL, G3000 PWXL and G2500PWXL; TosoHaas, Japan), in combination with a PWXL-guard column (40 \'d7 6 mm; TosoH, Japan). Elution was performed at 30 \'b0C with 0.2 M NaNO3 at a flow rate of 0.8 mL min\uc0\u8722 1. After injection of a 100-\u956 L sample, the eluting compounds were analyzed with a refractive index detector (Shodex RI-101, Showa Denko K.K., Japan). The data were processed using Chromeleon software (Dionex, United States).}
