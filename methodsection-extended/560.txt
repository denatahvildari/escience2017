\f0\fs22\fsmilli11040 \cf0 \uc0\u946 2\u8594 1-fructan formulations were tested for their elution profile using High Performance Size Exclusion Chromatography (HPSEC) on Dionex Ultimate 3000 HPLC (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). The analysis was performed on three TSK-Gel columns connected in series (4000-3000-2500 SuperAW; 150 x 6 mm). The columns were preceded by a TSK Super AW-L guard column (35 x 4.6 mm). All columns were from Tosoh Bioscience (Tokyo, Japan). Elution was performed at a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min. using sodium nitrate (0.2 M) as the eluent. A volume of 20 \'b5l of the sample (2.5 mg/ml) in millipore water was injected and eluted at 55\'b0C. Solubles were detected using a refractive index detector, Shodex type RI 101 (Showa Denko, Japan). The software used for acquiring the data was Chromeleon version 7. Molecular weight distribution of polysaccharides was determined using pullulan standards (Polymer Laboratories, Varian Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA) in the molecular mass range of 0.18 - 790 kDa.}
