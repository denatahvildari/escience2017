\f0\fs22\fsmilli11040 \cf0 Ten microlitres of sample were applied to a Vydac C18 reversed-phase column (300 \'c5; 5 \'b5m; 0.46 \'d7 25 cm; Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) on a Spectra System high-performance liquid chromatograph (Thermo Separation Products, Inc., San Jose, CA, USA) coupled to an LCQ mass spectrometer (Finnigan MAT, San Jose, CA, USA). The solvents used were water containing trifluoroacetic acid (1.5 mL L\uc0\u8722 1) (solvent A) and acetonitrile containing trifluoroacetic acid (1.5 mL L\u8722 1) (solvent B). The following gradient was applied: 0% B for 5 min, linear to 25% B between 5 and 45 min, linear to 50% B between 45 and 68 min, linear to 100% B between 68 and 77 min, 100% B between 77 min and 82 min, followed by reconditioning of the column at 0% B for 27 min. A flow rate of 0.2 mL min\u8722 1 was used. The absorbance of the eluate was monitored at 700 nm. }
