\f0\fs27\fsmilli13920 \cf0 PGXA, PGXB, PGXC and RGXB were purified by dialysis overnight at 4\'a0\'b0C against 50\'a0mM NaOAc (pH\'a05.7) and subsequent size-exclusion chromatography was performed on a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 50\'a0mM NaOAc (pH\'a05.7). The elution was carried out with the same buffer at a flow rate of 1\'a0ml/min, and fractions of 2\'a0ml were collected.}
