\f0\fs22\fsmilli11040 \cf0 The EPS (2 mg) was dissolved in 1 mL of distilled water and analysed by high performance size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) using pullulan for calibration. HPSEC was performed on a Thermo Quest HPLC using three TOSOHAAS TSK-Gel columns in series (6000-, 4000-, 3000PWXL) preceded by an TSK guard column (40\'d76 mm). Enzyme digests were analysed using three TOSOHAAS TSK-Gel columns in series (4000-, 3000-, 2500PWXL) preceded by an TSK guard column (40\'d76 mm). Elution took place at 30 \'b0C using 0.8 mL/min 0.2 M NaNO3 as eluent. Detection was performed using a Shodex RI 71 refractive index detector.}
