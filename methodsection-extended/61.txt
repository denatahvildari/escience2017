\f0\fs22\fsmilli11040 \cf0 After thawing, the 14000-rpm supernatant was\
analyzed with HPLC, performed with a Waters M600\
liquid chromatography system (Millipore Corporation,\
Bedford MA). Quercetin was quantified using\
an Alltima C18 5U column (4.6 \'a3 150 mm; Alltech,\
Breda, The Netherlands), eluting at a flow of\
1 ml/min. The injection volume was 10 ml. The\
gradient used for analysis of quercetin in the 0.1 M\
potassium phosphate pH 7.4 series was described\
previously [11]. The McCoy\'92s medium series were\
analyzed with a gradient starting at 0% acetonitril in\
nanopure water containing 0.1% trifluoracetic acid for\
2 min, going from 0 to 70% acetonitril in 22 min,\
keeping this percentage for 2 min and returning to 0%\
acetonitril in 1 min. Detection was performed\
between 230 and 420 nm using a Waters 996\
photodiode array detector. Quercetin peak areas at\
370 nm were used to quantify the amount of\
quercetin; amounts are expressed as percentage of\
the peak area at t \'bc 0 min.}
