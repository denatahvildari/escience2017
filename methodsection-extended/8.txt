\f0\fs22\fsmilli11040 \cf0 The on-line\
DPPH scavenging tests were performed using the method developed\
by Koleva et al. (16) and modified by Dapkevicius et al. (17) on an\
HPLC system equipped with a Waters 600E multisolvent delivery\
system (Millipore Corp., Waters Chromatography Division, Milford,\
MA), and an autosampling injector model 231 (Gilson Medical\
Electronics, Middleton, WI). The linear binary gradient was formed at\
a constant flow rate of 0.8 mL/min. Solvent A was a 20% methanol\
solution in water, and solvent B was 100% methanol. Initial isocratic\
conditions of 100% solvent A for 8 min was followed by an increase\
to 100% solvent B during 17 min, then isocratic conditions for 17 min.\
Finally, the gradient was returned to its initial conditions in 3 min and\
the column was equilibrated during 5 min. Separation of compounds\
was carried out on a 25 cm \'d7 0.46 cm i.d. end-capped Alltima C18\
analytical column (Alltech Associates, Deerfield, IL). Compounds eluted\
from the column were detected with a Waters 990 series photodiode\
array detector (Millipore) over the range 210-450 nm. Data were\
processed with Waters software, version LCA-6.22a. After the separation\
and detection, a 10-4 M solution of DPPH in methanol was added\
with a 45-mL laboratory-made syringe pump (Free University, Amsterdam,\
The Netherlands) at a flow rate of 0.70 mL/min.}
