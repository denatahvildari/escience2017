\f0\fs22\fsmilli11040 \cf0 A gas chromatograph (GC) (Mega 8060; Carlo Erba, Milan, Italy) with flame ionization detection (FID) and on-column injector was used to separate the FAMEs. The GC column (WCOT fused silica with stationary-phase CP-Wax 52 CB; Varian, The Netherlands) contained hydrogen as a carrier gas and was 15 m in length, with an inside diameter of 0.32 mm and a film thickness of 0.50 \uc0\u956 m. Data were analyzed with EZChrom Elite, version 3.1.4 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).}
