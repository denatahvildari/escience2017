\f0\fs22\fsmilli11040 \cf0 High-performance anion-exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection (HPAE-PAD) was performed using a Dionex ICS 3000 HPLC system equipped with a Dionex CarboPac PA-1 (4 mm ID \'d7 250 mm) column and an amino trap column (4 mm ID \'d7 50 mm) (Dionex, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Monosaccharides were separated using an isocratic elution with 20 mM NaOH for 25 min at 30 \'b0C at a flow-rate of 0.5 ml/min and detected with a pulsed amperometric detector [23]. Filtered mucus samples were hydrolysed in 2 M trifluoroacetic acid for 1 h at 121 \'b0C [24]. Glucose, fucose, galactose, galactosamine and glucosamine were used as a monosaccharide standard and fetuin as a glycoprotein standard}
