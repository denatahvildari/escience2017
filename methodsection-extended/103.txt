\f0\fs22\fsmilli11040 \cf0 Reversed phase HPLC was used for analysing saponins\
in peas. Evaporative Light Scattering Detection\
(ELSD) was used for sample separation and ion trap\
electrospray Mass Spectrometry (MS) was used for\
component identification. A SpectraSYSTEM HPLC\
(Thermo Separation Products, Fremont, CA) coupled\
to a Sedex 55 ELS detector (S.E.D.E.R.E., France) was\
used. Sample separations were performed using an\
Aquasil reversed-phase C18 column (4.6150 mm, 3\
mm) (Thermo Hypersil, Bellefonte, The Netherlands) attached to a guard column (410 mm, 3 mm) (Thermo\
Hypersil, Bellefonte, The Netherlands). The solvents\
used were water:acetic acid (100:0.1, v/v) (A) and acetonitrile:acetic\
acid (100:0.1, v/v) (B). The linear gradient\
used was as follows: 0\'9630 min, 10\'9630% B; 30\'9645 min,\
30\'9640% B; 45\'9660 min, 40\'96100% B; 60\'9680 min, 100% B.\
Samples were injected at 20 ml and a flowrate of 1 ml/\
min was used. The sample eluting from the column was\
split into three directions: 100 ml/min to the ELSD, 50\
ml/min to the LCQ Ion-trap MS (Finnigan MAT 95,\
San Jose, CA) and 850 ml/min to the waste. The ELSD\
was set at 40 C at a gas pressure of 2.3 bars and a sensitivity\
of 12. MS analysis was performed in the positive\
mode using a spray voltage of 5.5 kV, a capillary voltage\
of 15 V and a capillary temperature of 200 C. A full\
scan mass spectrum over an m/z (mass to charge ratio)\
range of 150\'961500 was obtained. The mass spectra were\
recorded and analysed with the use of Xcalibur software\
(version 1.2, Windows NT 4 with service pack 6a).}
