\f0\fs22\fsmilli11040 \cf0 Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) was performed on a \'c4KTA micro liquid chromatography system equipped with a Superose 6 column (both GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden). The samples (50 \uc0\u956 L, 
\f1 \uc0\u8764 
\f0 10 mg/mL protein) were eluted with 50 mM Tris/HCl buffer (pH 8) containing 150 mM NaCl at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min at room temperature. Elution was monitored by UV detection at 280 nm (internal detector) and by refractive index detection (Shodex RI150, Showa Denko K.K., Tokyo, Japan). }
