\f0\fs22\fsmilli11040 \cf0 High-performance size-exclusion chromatography was performed on two 300 \'d7 7.8 mm i.d. TSKgel columns in series (G4000 PWXL and G2500 PWXL) (TosoHaas, Stuttgart, Germany), in combination with a PWX-guard column. Elution took place at 40 \'b0C with 0.2 M sodium nitrate at 0.8 mL/min. The eluate was monitored by refractive index detection using a Spectra System RI-150 detector, and the absorbance was measured at 280, 325, and 405 nm using a Spectra System UV2000. The sample was dissolved in the eluent and was centrifuged prior to injection (100 \'b5L).}
