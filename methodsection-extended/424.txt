\f0\fs22\fsmilli11040 \cf0 Monomeric sugars were analyzed using high-performance anion-exchange chromatography-pulsed amperometric detection (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) analysis as described previously (Sengkhamparn et al., 2009). Total uronic acid contents were determined after pre-hydrolysis in aqueous 72% (w/w) H2SO4 (1 h, 30 \'b0C) and subsequent hydrolysis in 1 M H2SO4 (3 h, 100 \'b0C) using an automated m-hydroxydiphenyl assay ( Ahmed and Labavitch, 1978). A galacturonic acid standard curve (12.5\'96100 \uc0\u956 g/mL) was used for quantification. Analyses were carried out in duplicate.}
