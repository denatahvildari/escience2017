\f0\fs22\fsmilli11040 \cf0 HPAEC (high-performance anion-exchange chromatography)\
was performed on a Dionex (USA) HPLC system.\
The system was equipped with a quaternary gradient pump,\
an autosampler completed with a helium degassing unit\
and an EC detector in the PAD mode. A CarboPac PA1\
column (2\'a3250 mm) (Dionex, USA) with a CarboPac PA1\
guard column (2\'a350 mm) (Dionex, USA) was operated at\
a Xow rate of 0.3 mL/min at 20 \'b0C. The gradient was\
obtained by mixing solutions of 0.1 mol/L NaOH and\
1 mol/L NaOAc in 0.1 mol/L NaOH. After 15 min equilibration\
with 0.1 mol/L NaOH, 20L of the sample was\
injected and a linear gradient to 0.50 mol/L NaOAc in\
0.1 mol/L NaOH within 30 min was followed by a linear\
gradient in 5 min to 1 mol/L NaOAc in 0.1 mol/L NaOH.\
Finally, the column was washed for 5 min with 1 mol/L\
NaOAc in 0.1 mol/L NaOH. The data were processed using\
Chromeleon (Dionex, USA) software.}
