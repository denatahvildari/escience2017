\f0\fs22\fsmilli11040 \cf0 the extent of oligosaccharide degradation was determined in samples collected from TIM-2 (conditions ii and iii) by High performance anion exchange chromatography (HPAEC) on a Dionex ISC 3000 system (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA), equipped with a Dionex CarboPac PA-1 column (2 \'d7 250 mm) in combination with a CarboPac PA-1 guard column (2 \'d7 50 mm) (Albrecht et al., 2009). Briefly, samples were adjusted to a final theoretical concentration of 0.05 mg mL\uc0\u8722 1 GOS (assuming no degradation), heated at 100 \'b0C for 10 min for inactivation of digestive enzymes, and 20 \u956 L was injected through a Dionex ISC3000 autosampler. The oligosaccharides were eluted (0.3 mL min\u8722 1) by a gradient of 0\'96400 mM sodium acetate in 100 mM NaOH over 40 min. Each elution was followed by a washing step (5 min, 1 M NaOAc in 100 mM NaOH) and an equilibration step (20 min, 100 mM NaOH). The detection was carried out using a Dionex ED40 detector in pulsed amperometric detection (PAD) mode.}
