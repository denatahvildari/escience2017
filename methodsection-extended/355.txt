\f0\fs22\fsmilli11040 \cf0 MHR samples (250 \uc0\u956 L; 5 mg/mL) were separated and fractionated on a Dionex Propac\'99 WAX-10 column (250 \'d7 4 mm) according to Guillotin et al.30 using a Akta Purifier (GE Healthcare). Separation was monitored using UV 210 nm absorption, and fractions of 0.5 mL were collected in 96-well plates. The fractions were subsequently pooled for sugar composition analysis or further analyzed using ELISA detection with MAbs against different pectic epitopes.}
