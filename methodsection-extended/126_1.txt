\f0\fs22\fsmilli11040 \cf0 For high-performance anion-exchange chromatography\
(HPAEC) analysis, a Thermo Quest HPLC is used which\
included a quaternary gradient pump and AS3000 auto-sampler\
completed with a Helium degassing unit and a PED detector in\
PAD mode (Dionex, USA). The data was processed using a\
Thermo Quest PC 1000 data handling system. A CarboPac PA1\
column (4!250 mm) with guard column (Dionex, USA) was\
operated at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min at 20 8C. The gradient\
was obtained by mixing solutions of 0.1 mol/L NaOH and\
1 mol/L NaOAc in 0.1 mol/L NaOH. After 15 min equilibration\
with 0.1 mol/L NaOH, 20 mL of the sample was\
injected and a linear gradient to 0.50 mol/L NaOAc in\
0.1 mol/L NaOH within 30 min was followed by a linear\
gradient in 5 min to 1 mol/L NaOAc in 0.1 mol/L NaOH.\
Finally, the column was washed for 5 min with 1 mol/L\
NaOAc in 0.1 mol/L NaOH}
