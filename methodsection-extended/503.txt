\f0\fs22\fsmilli11040 \cf0 The HPAEC-PAD system (DX-600, Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA, USA; now Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was equipped with a CarboPac PA-1 column and a CarboPac PA-1 guard column (4.6 mm \'d7 250 mm and 4.6 mm \'d7 50 mm; Dionex). A flow rate of 1 mL/min was used and the column temperature was maintained at 30 \'b0C. The injection volume was 25 \uc0\u956 L. The mobile phase was composed of (A) H2O, (B) 0.25 M NaOH and (C) 0.65 M NaOAc. The eluent profile was as follows: 0\'9615 min, isocratic 90% A and 10% B; 15\'9620 min, linearly to 70% A and 30% B; 20\'9630 min, linearly to 30% A, 30% B and 40% C; 30\'9632 min isocratic 30% A, 30% B and 40% C; 32\'9635 min, linearly to the initial conditions 90% A and 10% B; 35\'9645 min, isocratic 90% A and 10% B. The system was controlled using Empower software (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, USA).}
