\f0\fs22\fsmilli11040 \cf0 The\
molecular weight distribution of large oligosaccharide and polysaccharide\
fractions was investigated by high performance size\
exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) using a Spectra System\
HPLC (Thermo Finnigan) equipped with a refractive index detector\
Shodex RI72 (Showa Denko K.K.). Twenty microliter sample\
solutions (5 mg/mL) were injected automatically, using a Thermo\
AS3000 autosampler. Separation was performed on three TosoH\
Biosep-TSK-Gel G columns in series (4000PWXL-415\
3000PWXL-2500PWXL, each 300   7.5 mm; TosoH, Japan) in\
combination with a PWXL guard column (40   6 mm; TosoH). For\
elution, 0.2 M NaNO3 was used at a flow rate of 0.8 mL/min at\
30  C. The system was calibrated with pullulan standards (Sigma\
Chemical Co.; mass range from 180 Da to 790 kDa).}
