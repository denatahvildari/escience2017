\f0\fs22\fsmilli11040 \cf0 Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC). Protein samples were applied onto either a 320 mL Superdex 200 XK 26/60 column (5-13 mL applied per run) or a 25 mL Superose 6 10/30 column (100 \'b5L applied per run; GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden). The columns were equilibrated and eluted with 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.2, with or without 0.3 M NaCl, at a flow rate of 4.3 or 0.5 mL min-1 , respectively, using an A\'a8 kta purifier system (GE Healthcare). The Superose column was calibrated using a gel filtration calibration kit according to the instructions of the supplier (GE Healthcare). The eluate was monitored at 280 and 325 nm, and appropriate fractions were collected.}
