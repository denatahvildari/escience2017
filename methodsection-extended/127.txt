\f0\fs27\fsmilli13920 \cf2 High-performance size-exclusion chromatography was performed on three TSKgel columns (7.8\'a0mm ID\'a0\'d7\'a030\'a0cm per column) in series (G4000 PWXL, G3000 PWXL, G2500 PWXL; Tosohaas, Stuttgart, Germany), in combination with a PWX-guard column (Tosohaas, Stuttgart, Germany). Elution took place at 30\'a0\'b0C with 0.2\'a0M sodium nitrate at 0.8\'a0mL/min. The eluate was monitored by refractive index detection using a Shodex RI-72 detector. Calibration was performed using dextrans.}
