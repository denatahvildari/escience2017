\f0\fs22\fsmilli11040 \cf0 A Waters Alliance W2690 HPLC system with a PDA detector (Model 996) was used to determine the purity of the ellagitannins isolated by preparative HPLC. Compound separation was achieved using a Zorbax Rapid Resolution SB\'96C18, 1.8 \uc0\u956 m, 4.6 \'d7 150 mm column (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) with a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min and 5 \u956 l injection volume. Solvents were concentrated formic acid:H2O (5:95; A), and 100% acetonitrile (B). The ellagitannins were separated using the following gradient system. The solvent composition programme was as follows: initial 5% B, 5\'9620% B in 10 min, 20\'9680% B in 3 min and held at 80% B for 4 min; before returning to the initial conditions. Chromatograms were recorded at 280 nm.}
