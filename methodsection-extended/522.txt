\f0\fs22\fsmilli11040 \cf0 HPSEC was performed on a Dionex Ultimate 3000 system (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). A set of three TSK-Gel columns (Tosoh Bioscience, Tokyo, Japan) was used in series with separation columns G-6000PW, G-3000PW and G-2500PW (7.8 mm \'d7 300 mm). The column temperature was set at 55 \'b0C. The samples (20 \uc0\u956 L, 2 mg mL\u8722 1) were eluted with 1% (v/v) ethylene glycol in 0.2-\u956 m-filtered 0.2 M NaNO3 at a flow rate of 0.8 mL min\u8722 1 (Milas et al., 1986). The eluate was monitored using refractive index detection (Shodex RI 101; Showa Denko K.K., Kawasaki, Japan).}
