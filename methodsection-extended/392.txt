\f0\fs22\fsmilli11040 \cf0 the dried extract was dissolved in methanol/water (1:1 v/v), filtered (0.45 \uc0\u956 m filter) and injected (20 \u956 L) on a reverse phase high-performance liquid chromatograph (RP-HPLC) equipped with an Alltima C18 5 \u956 m column (250 mm \'d7 4.6  mm; Alltech). UV detection was carried out using a Waters 996 photodiode array detector at 320 nm. Linear gradient elution was performed with acetonitrile/sodium acetate buffer (0.05 mol/l) at 1 ml/min and 35 \'b0C, from 15:85 to 35:65 in 30 min and from 35:65 to 60:40 in 0.5 min, followed by a re-equilibration step (from 60:40 to 15:85 in 4.5 min and then maintained at 15:85 for 5 min). The various forms of ferulic acid (monomer, dimmers, and trimer) were identified according to their UV absorption spectra, and quantified according to the response factors determined for pure compounds at 320 nm by Saulnier et al.}
