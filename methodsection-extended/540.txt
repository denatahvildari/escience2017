\f0\fs22\fsmilli11040 \cf0 Analyses of molecular weight distribution of oligo- and polysaccharides were performed using high performance size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC). For this, an Ultimate 3000 HPLC (Thermo Scientific) was used with three TosoHaas TSK-gel columns in series (4000, 3000 and 2500 SuperAW; each 150 mm \'d7 6 mm; TosoHaas, Japan) preceded by a TSK Super AW-L guard column (3.5 cm \'d7 4.6 mm; TosoHaas). 20 \uc0\u956 L of sample (0.002 g/mL) was injected and eluted with 0.2 M sodium nitrate at a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min at 55 \'b0C. Detection was performed with a refractive index detector Shodex R101 (Showa Denko, Japan). The system was controlled using Chromeleon (version 7) software (Dionex, USA; now ThermoScientific, USA). For calibration, pullulan standards (Sigma; mass range of 180 Da to 790 kDa) and pectin standards (mass range of 2.8\'96100 kDa) were used.}
