\f0\fs22\fsmilli11040 \cf0 Determination of leucine, \uc0\u945 -ketoisocaproic acid, \u945 -hydroxyisocaproic acid and isovaleric acid was performed on an HPLC system consisting of two M6000A peristaltic pumps (Waters, Milford, Mass.), a type 680 gradient controller (Waters), a Spectro flow 783 UV detector at 220 nm (Kratos, Ramsey, N.J.) and a wide pore C18 4.6\'d7250 mm RP column preceded by a C18 guard column (Bio-Rad, Richmond, Calif.). The column was equilibrated with 2% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluor acetic acid (TFA) in water before applying 50 \'b5l sample. Components were eluted at 30\'b0C at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min using a 20 min gradient from 2% to 12% acetonitrile +0.1% TFA. The column was washed after each run by a 5 min gradient from 12 to 60% acetonitrile +0.1% TFA. Concentrations were calculated by using calibration samples containing \u945 -ketoisocaproic acid and leucine in water ranging from 100 to 500 \'b5M.}
