\f0\fs22\fsmilli11040 \cf0 Diluted samples were filtered using a 13 mm HPLC Altech syringe Flt 0.45 \uc0\u956 m PTFE 100 pk (BD Discardit syringe). HPLC, Ultimate 3000 (Dionex), using a Varian Polaris C18a 46 \'d7 150 mm column (Bio-Rad) with pre-column and single detection mode at 245 nm wavelength (UV absorption, Thermo Separation Products UV2000) was used for determination. Elution was with 20 g L\u8722 1 orthophosphoric acid at a flow rate of 1 ml min\u8722 1. Glucose, fructose, mannitol, ethanol, lactic acid and acetic acid were determined by HPLC as described earlier}
