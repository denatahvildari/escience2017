\f0\fs22\fsmilli11040 \cf0 SE-high performance\
liquid chromatography (HPLC) analyses were carried out\
using a Waters HPLC system consisting of a Waters 600E solvent\
delivery/control system with a Waters 717 automatic sampler injector\
and a Waters 2487 Dual Wavelength Absorbance Detector. The column,\
a TSK-Gel G-2000 SWXL (300 mm \'d7 7.8 mm), was fitted with a\
matching guard column (TSK-Gel SW, 7.5 mm \'d7 7.5 mm) and was\
maintained at 25 \'b0C. Both columns were from TosoHaas (Tokyo,\
Japan). Before analysis, the samples were diluted with the eluent buffer\
also containing 1% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) to minimize\
casein self-aggregation and were filtered through 0.45 um Orange\
Scientific Gyrodisc-PES 13 filters, and 20 \'b5L of the supernatant was injected into the column. The components were eluted with 0.1 M\
sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 0.3 M NaCl, at a flow\
rate of 0.25 mL/min, and detected at 280 and 320 nm. The column\
was calibrated with standards of known molecular mass. The protein\
standards were R-lactalbumin (14.2 kDa), chymotrypsin (25.7 kDa),\
BSA (66 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), and catalase (232 kDa). The SE\
limit of the column was \uc0\u8776 300 kDa. The void volume of the column\
was experimentally determined with blue dextran (2000 kDa) and\
corresponded to Rt ) 27.8 min. The relative abundance of reagent\
protein and reaction products in the reaction mixture was expressed as\
proportion (%) of the total peak area determined at 280 nm.}
