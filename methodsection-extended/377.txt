\f0\fs22\fsmilli11040 \cf0 High-performance anion exchange chromatography (HPAEC) was performed on an HPLC system (Dionex, United States). The system was equipped with a quaternary gradient pump, an AS3000 autosampler with a helium degassing unit and an ED40 EC detector in pulsed amperometric detection (PAD) mode. The CarboPac PA1 column (2 \'d7 250 mm; Dionex, United States) with a CarboPac PA1 guard column (2 \'d7 50 mm; Dionex) was operated at a flow rate of 0.3 mL min\uc0\u8722 1 at 20 \'b0C. 20 \u956 L of 10-fold diluted sample was injected and a linear gradient from 0.00 to 0.5 M NaOAc in 0.1 M NaOH within 40 min was applied, followed by a linear gradient in 5 min to 1 M NaOAc in 0.1 M NaOH. Finally, the column was washed for 5 min with 1 M NaOAc in 0.1 M NaOH, and equilibrated for 20 min with 0.1 M NaOH. The data were processed using Chromeleon software (Dionex, United States).}
